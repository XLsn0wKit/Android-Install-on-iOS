  How to build Sandcastle AOSP
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, obtain AOSP 10.0.0_r3 according to instructions at:

    https://source.android.com/setup/build/downloading

You can use branch android-10.0.0_r3 to speed up check-out.

After this, apply the attached diff file to the repository.

Then, you will need to install a 16kB page compatible build
of WebView:

    cp webview.apk external/chromium-webview/prebuilt/arm64

Finally, unpack the OpenLauncher APK and the NAND tool:

    tar -C packages/apps/openlauncher xzf openlauncher.tar.gz
    tar xzf build-nand-1.1.tar.gz

After this, run build.sh (adjust -j for your CPU count) and
give it a while. If it goes well, you are ready to build the
NAND image:

    cd build-nand-1.1
    ./filldisk.sh

This will produce a file called 'nand' containing the required
partition layout.
